Description: Partition exchangeabilty supervised predictive classifiers, parameter tests and estimation. This package implements a supervised predictive classifier under partition exchangeability. The two classifiers implemented are a marginal classifier that assumes test data is i.i.d., and a more computationally costly but more accurate simultaneous classifier that tries to find a labeling for the entire test dataset at once, using all of the test data to predict each label. We present functions to simulate samples and gain sample probabilities from the Ewens sampling formula (or Poisson-Dirichlet distribution). Parameter estimation and a hypothesis testing function of the distribution are included.
