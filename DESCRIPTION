Description: This package implements a supervised predictive classifier under partition exchangeability (Zabell 1992 <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00485351>). The two classifiers implemented are a marginal classifier that assumes test data is i.i.d., and a more computationally costly but more accurate simultaneous classifier that tries to find a labeling for the entire test dataset at once, using all of the test data to predict each label (Amiryousefi (2021) <arXiv2101.10950>). We present functions to simulate samples and gain sample probabilities from the Ewens sampling formula (or Poisson-Dirichlet distribution). Parameter estimation and a hypothesis testing function of the distribution are included [Ewens (1973) <https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-5809(72)90035-4>].
